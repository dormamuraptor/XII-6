            <p>Fun fact: This article used to be about Finnish music producers, but I decided to scrap it because of how hard it is. Instead, I'm doing a biography about DJVI himself because... well it's more fun! :P</p>
            <p>Since I'm also a DJVI fan, why don't I create something about him... and maybe for him?
                Either way, I had fun creating this as some sort of passion project. The silly blog by yours truly!</p>
                So anyways, here are table of contents for you to navigate quicker.</p>

            <p>DJVI is a music producer born on 2nd of July 1992 in southern Finland. He primarily makes electronic music, ranging from techno, house, dubstep, hardstyle, and drum n' bass.
                His songs are mostly featured in music-based games like Geometry Dash, Dash till Puff!, Dub Dash, Beaty Cubes, etc. Music production isn't his primary job, that is his hobby and passion.
                Instead, his primary job is an HVAC engineer. He currently lives in Vantaa.</p>
                <p>His music passion started from his love towards old-school techno music from the 2000s and artists such as Mangoo, ItaloBrothers, Basshunter, and B0UNC3.
                    He soon decided to get a demo version of FL Studio in 2008 and made small loops. in 2010, He published his first song on Newgrounds titled All I Need.</p>
                    <p>Soon, he found his first ever fame when six of his songs got featured in a game called Geometry Dash back in 2013 when the developer RobTop was looking for songs for his game and he made a forum for artists to send their songs.
                    The songs in question are in <a class="linky" href="#song">song examples</a> (not all), so please go there if you wanna see it. :P</p>
                    <p>In 2014, he thought of leaving Newgrounds for YouTube and in 2015 he founded his music label Sound Ward, however, this got shut down in 2017 due to stress and high competition. Currently, he's an independent artist not under any labels.
                        <p>His first approach in doing something different to his music was in 2022 when he initiated his first story based on his songs titled <a class="linky" href="https://djvimusic.com/lore/">Scions of the Multiverse</a>, available on his official website.
                        <i>Fun fact: I draw the characters for his story, however I shall give credit to Civiler for the character traits that make up the backbones of the characters haha.</i></p>
